## About
**TLDR: RateMyProfs for Study Spots.**

### *Mission Statement*
We plan to make studying more convenient and comfortable by providing available study spaces for all UBC students. 

### *Planning*
Many UBC students encounter the issue of not being able to find a quiet study spot, especially at UBC's most popular library, IKB. So, we have decided to create a platform for students to review and to find their favourite study spot.

#### *Main Student/User Stories:*
- As a student/user, I want to filter study spaces by amenities (e.g. power outlets, study rooms, quiet areas), so that I can find a space that meets my specific needs.
- As a student/user, I want to be able to find locations of study space, so that I can find convenient places to study near me.
- As a student/user, I want to rate study spaces on various criteria (e.g., noise level, comfort), so that I can share my experience with others.
- As a student/user, I want to write detailed reviews of study spaces, so that I can provide helpful feedback for other students/users.
- As a student/user, I want to see ratings and reviews of study spaces, so that I can make informed decisions about where to study.
- As a student/user, I want to see the most recent and relevant reviews first, so that I get up-to-date information.
- As a student/user, I want to be able to add new study spaces to the website, so that I can share hidden gems with the community.
- As a student/user, I want to be able to create an account, so that I can write reviews, suggest study spots, and contribute to the community.
- As a student/user, I want to be able to acces the website on mobile devices, so that I can search for and reveiw study spaces on the go.

#### *Roadmap / Planned Features:*
- Planned to expand to other Greater Vancouver Area campuses (SFU, BCIT, etc).
- Planned to add study spaces outside of campuses (coffee shops, public libraries, etc).
- Planned to add the ability to bookmark and save a user's favourite study spaces.
- Planned to add an AI chatbot to recommend the best study spots on campus (if enough people support the idea).
- Planned to add more filters and ways to sort study spots and reviews.
