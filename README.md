## About
*Mission Statement* \
We plan to make studying more convenient and comfortable by providing available study spaces for all UBC students. 

*Planning* \
Many UBC students encounter the issue of not being able to find a quiet study spot, especially at UBC's most popular library, IKB. So, these two founders have come together to solve this problem through seeker. They've planned the app with the following goals in mind:

- give students great study space options that are comfortable, quiet and perfect for studying;
- ensure study spaces are transparent with what features and qualities are available at each spot (crowdedness, outlet availabilty, unique access or general access, etc);
- making the application user-friendly and intuitive for a seamless user experience;
- and ultimately, making studying easier for students
